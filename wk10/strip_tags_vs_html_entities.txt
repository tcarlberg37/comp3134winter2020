Using the php function strip_tags() on the content entered in the form removes all HTML tags that are entered in
the input tag of the form and outputs just the string text.

Using the htmlentities() php function will decode any non-alphanumeric characters into their ASCII codes, thus
making it impossible to inject javascript/html into the form
