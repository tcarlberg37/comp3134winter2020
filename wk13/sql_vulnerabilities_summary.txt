Part G

1) Entering "Ben" will search the database for firstname = "Ben" with active = 1
	No results are returned because Ben has active = 0

2) This query will work because entering '-- makes a SQL comment so the part of the query where we say active = 1
	is commented out by this SQL injection

3) Entering "Ben' or 1=1" will return all rows because with this SQL injection we make every result true since 1=1
