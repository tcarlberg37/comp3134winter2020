when navigating to http://159.89.127.140/directory_traversal_part1.php?q=%2e%2e%2f
	- the browser shows the contents of the /var/www folder which contains the html directory
	- this is because %2e%2e%2f == ../ which goes up one directory from the html directory
	- from here we could navigate into all the web files contained on this droplet server
