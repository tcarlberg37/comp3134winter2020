1) What is the definition of server port?
	A server port is a connection endpoint that is used by a process or network service that is distinguished by a port number. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UCP) are the most common protocols that use port numbers.

2) What is server port range?
	0 to 65535 (2^16 - 1) but only port numbers 0 to 1023 are used for well known port numbers.

3) How many bits does number above represent?
	65535 = (2^16 - 1) = 15 bits, 1023 = (2^10 - 1) = 9 bits

4) State 10 common server ports:
	20 = FTP Transfer port
	22 = SSH login port
	25 = SMTP email routing port 
	53 = DNS port
	67 = DHCP port 
	80 = HTTP port
	123 = NTP (Network Time Protocol) port
	143 = IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) port
