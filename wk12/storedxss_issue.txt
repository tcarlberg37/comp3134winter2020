when you read and output from a file directly with PHP, it writes whatever is in the file right into the HTML of
the document. So since we put a javascript command to link to the directory traversal page in the text file, as
soon as it is read our page goes to the directory traversal file. This could be used by an attacker to look into
any file on the system.
